%% Currently there are very few unicode math fonts so we load fontspec %%
%% with the no-math option. This means that math fonts are defined %%%%
%% by traditional LaTeX means. Here we load the Euler fonts. %%%%%%%%%%%
%% An alternative is to delete the no-math option and enable %%%%%%%%%%
%% unicode-math and Cambria Math fonts %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% If all else fails, you can always load the "kerkis" package %%%%%%%%%%%%
